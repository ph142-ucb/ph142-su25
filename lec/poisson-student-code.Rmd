## R functions for the poisson

### Poisson distribution in R
In R the poisson distribution is represented by `pois`

When working with the binomial distribution, we used `dbinom` and `pbinom`
to calculate probabilities.

With the poisson distribution we will use `dpois` and `ppois`


In R, the function to calculate $P(X=x)$ for a poisson `dpois(x=?, lambda=?)`,
where `lambda` ($\lambda$) is equal to the average $\mu$ (which is the book's notation).


More detail on syntax is [*here*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Poisson.html)

### Example: Mumps

In Iowa, the average monthly number of reported cases of mumps per year is 0.1.
If we assume that cases of mumps are random and independent, the number $X$ of 
monthly mumps cases in Iowa has approximately a Poisson distribution with 
$\mu=0.1$. The probability that in a given month there is no more than 1 mumps 
case is:

$P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)$ 


$$P(X=k)={\frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^k}{k!} }$$


### Example: Mumps


$P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)$ 


$$P(X=k)={\frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^k}{k!} }$$

= ${\frac{e^{-0.1} 0.1^0}{0!} } + {\frac{e^{-0.1} 0.1^1}{1!} }$ (note that 0! = 1, by definition, and $x^0$=1, for any value of x.)

= 0.9048 + 0.0905 = 0.9953 

Thus, we expect to only see 0 cases 90.5% of the months, and 1 case 9.05% of the
time. 

### Example: Mumps calculated using R using `ppois()` and `dpois()`

```{r}
dpois(x = 0, lambda = 0.1) + dpois(x = 1, lambda = 0.1)

# or, 

ppois(q = 1, lambda = 0.1) # notice that lambda is the parameter
```

### Example: Mumps, continued

Suppose you saw 4 cases of Mumps in a given month. What are the chances of seeing
4 or more cases in any given month?

```{r}
1 - ppois(q = 3, lambda = 0.1) #careful, we used q = 3 here, why 3 and not 4?
```

Could you have performed this calculation using `dpois()`?

If you saw 4 or more cases in any given month, this is very unlikely under this
model. This suggests a substantial departure from the model, suggesting a 
contagious outbreak (no longer independent)

### Example: Polydactyly

In the US, 1 in every 500 babies is born with an extra finger or toe. These 
events are random and independent. Suppose that the local hospital delivers an
average of 268 babies per month. This means that for each month we expect to see
0.536 babies born with an extra finger or toe at that hospital (how do you calculate 
0.536 here?). Let $X$ be the count of babies born with an extra finger or toe in a
month at that hospital.

a) What values can $X$ take?
b) What distribution might $X$ follow?
c) Give the mean and standard deviation of $X$.

### Example: Polydactyly, continued

To get a sense of what the data might look like, use R to simulate data across
five years (60 months) for this hospital.

```{r}
set.seed(200)
polydactyly<-(rpois(n = 12*5, lambda = 0.536))
polydactyly
```

### Example: Polydactyly, continued
```{r}
hist(polydactyly)
```

### Example: Polydactyly, continued
```{r}
mean(polydactyly)
sd(polydactyly)
```

### More random number generation 

Examining a stream of Poisson-distributed random numbers helps us get a sense
of what these data look like. Can you think of a variable that might be Poisson-
distributed according to one of these distributions?

```{r}
rpois(100, lambda = 0.1)
rpois(100, lambda = 1)
```
