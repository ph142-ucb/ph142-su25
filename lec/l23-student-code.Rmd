## Example using all four CI methods


### Example applying all the methods

Suppose that 500 elderly individuals suffered hip fractures, of which
100 died within a year of their fracture. Compute the 95% CI for the proportion
who died using:

- the large sample method, 
- the plus for method (by hand),
- the Wilson Score method (using `prop.test`), 
- the Clopper Pearson Exact method (using `binom.test`)

### Example of large sample method to the CI for a proportion

```{r}
p.hat <- 100/500 # estimate proportion
se <- sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/500) # standard error
c(p.hat - 1.96*se, p.hat + 1.96*se) # CI
```

Using the large sample method, the confidence interval is 16.5% to 23.5%.

Note that you could compute this by hand.

### Example using the Clopper Pearson "Exact" method to the CI for a proportion

```{r}
binom.test(x = 100, n = 500, conf.level = 0.95)
```

- The 95% confidence interval using the exact binomial test is 16.6% to 23.8%.


### Example using the Clopper Pearson "Exact" method to the CI for a proportion
- Note that the `binom.test` function is also conducting a two-sided hypothesis 
test (where $H_0: p_0=0.5$, unless otherwise specified). You can ignore the 
testing-related output and focus on the CI output when using the function to 
make a CI. 

### Example using the Wilson Score method to the CI for a proportion

```{r}
prop.test(x = 100, n = 500, conf.level = 0.95)
```

- The 95% confidence interval using the Wilson Score method is 16.6% to 23.8%.

### Example using the Wilson Score method to the CI for a proportion
- Note that the `prop.test` function is also conducting a two-sided hypothesis 
test (where $H_0: p_0=0.5$, unless otherwise specified). You can ignore the 
testing-related output and focus on the CI output when using the function to 
make a CI. 

### Example using the plus 4 method

```{r plus-four}
p.tilde <- (100 + 2)/(500 + 4)
se <- sqrt(p.tilde*(1-p.tilde)/504) # standard error
c(p.tilde - 1.96*se, p.tilde + 1.96*se) # CI
```

Using the plus 4 method, the confidence interval is 16.7% to 23.7%.

### Comparison of the four methods

We can graphically compare the CIs :

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
# students, dont worry about this code
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
elderly_CIs <- tibble(method = c("large sample", "Exact", "Wilson", "Plus 4"),
       lower = c(16.5, 16.6, 16.6, 16.7),
       upper = c(23.5, 23.8, 23.8, 23.7),
       estimate = rep(20,4))

ggplot(data = elderly_CIs, 
       aes(x = method, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = method, y = lower, yend = upper)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), lty = 2) +
  labs(y = "Estimate and 95% CI", x = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Summary of the confidence intervals across the methods

| Method       | 95% Confidence Interval | R Function       |
|--------------|:-----------------------:|------------|
| Large sample | 16.5% to 23.5%          | by hand      |
| Exact        | 16.6% to 23.8%          | `binom.test` |
| Wilson Score* | 16.6% to 23.8%          | `prop.test`  |
| Plus four    | 16.7% to 23.7%          | by hand      |

*with continuity correction

- Note that only the large sample method is symmetric around $\hat{p} = 20\%$. This is
okay. There is no reason why we require a symmetric confidence interval. 

- When the Normal approximation assumptions are satisfied, the methods give very
similar results, as shown here.

### Example 2

Suppose that there were 100 elderly individuals with falls observed, and 2 died.



### Example 2
Large sample and plus four method calculations

```{r large-sample}
p.hat <- 2/100 # estimate proportion
se <- sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/100) # standard error
c(p.hat - 1.96*se, p.hat + 1.96*se) # CI
```

```{r plus-4-method}
p.tilde <- (2 + 2)/(100 + 4)
se <- sqrt(p.tilde*(1-p.tilde)/104) # standard error
c(p.tilde - 1.96*se, p.tilde + 1.96*se) # CI
```

### Example 2

```{r exact-method}
binom.test(x = 2, n = 100, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Example 2

```{r wilson-score}
prop.test(x = 2, n = 100, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Example 2 summary 

Here are the 95% CIs applying the four different methods:

| Method       | 95% Confidence Interval | R Function       |
|--------------|:-----------------------:|--------------|
| Large sample | -0.74% to 4.74%          | by hand      |
| Exact        | 0.024% to 7.04%          | `binom.test` |
| Wilson Score* | 0.034% to 7.74%          | `prop.test`  |
| Plus four    | 0.15% to 7.54%           | by hand      |

*with continuity correction

### Example 2

We can graphically compare the CIs from the previous slide:

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
# students, dont worry about this code
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
elderly_CIs <- tibble(method = c("large sample", "Exact", "Wilson", "Plus 4"),
       lower = c(-0.74, 0.024, 0.034, 0.15),
       upper = c(4.74, 7.04, 7.74, 7.54),
       estimate = rep(2,4))

ggplot(data = elderly_CIs, 
       aes(x = method, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = method, y = lower, yend = upper)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), lty = 2) +
  labs(y = "Estimate and 95% CI", x = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```


### Example of a hypothesis test for a proportion

Consider a SRS of 200 patients undergoing treatment to alleviate side-effects 
from a rigorous drug regimen at a particular hospital, where 33 patients 
experienced reduced or no side-effects. 

$\hat{p}=33/200=0.165=16.5\%$

Suppose that historically, the rate of patients with little or no side-effects is
10%. Does the new treatment increase the rate? That is:

$H_0: p = 0.10$ vs. $H_a: p > 0.10$

### Example of a hypothesis test for a proportion

Step 1: Calculate $\hat{p} = 16.5\%$ from previous slide.

Step 2: Calculate the standard error of the sampling distribution for $p$ under
the null hypothesis: $SE = \frac{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}}{n} = \frac{\sqrt{0.1(1-0.1)}}{200} = 0.0212132$

Step 3: Calculate the z-test for the proportion:

$z = \frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} = \frac{0.165-0.10}{0.0212132} = 3.06413$

### Example of a hypothesis test for a proportion
Step 4: Calculate the probability of seeing a z-value of this magnitude *or larger*:

```{r}
pnorm(q = 3.06413, lower.tail = F)
```

Step 5: Evaluate the evidence against the null hypothesis. Because the p-value is 
so small (0.1%), there is little chance of seeing a proportion equal to 16.5%
or larger if the true proportion was actually 10%. Thus, there is evidence in 
favor of the alternative hypothesis, that the underlying proportion is larger
than 10%.
