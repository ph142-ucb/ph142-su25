### From B&M: How common is the common cold?

- Here are the dimensions, a data frame for the **whole population**, and the mean 
of the variable `had_cold_yesterday`:

```{r create-cold-data, echo=F}
#students: you don't need to understand this code chunk yet. 

population_size <- 100000
prob_cold <- 0.112
id <- 1:population_size
set.seed(1234)
# Generate n random binomial samples (coin flips) where 
# probability of cold (heads) is prob_cold
had_cold_yesterday <- rbinom(n = population_size, size = 1, prob = prob_cold) 
#each person has an 11.2% chance of having the common cold yesterday
cold_data <- data.frame(id, had_cold_yesterday)
```

```{r}
dim(cold_data)
cold_data %>% summarize(population_mean = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
```

- Let's take samples of size 5, 100, and so on using `dplyr`'s `sample_n`
function:

```{r the-smallest-samples}
sample_5 <- dplyr::sample_n(tbl = cold_data, size = 5)
sample_100 <- dplyr::sample_n(tbl = cold_data, size = 100)
sample_1000 <- dplyr::sample_n(tbl = cold_data, size = 1000)
sample_10000 <- dplyr::sample_n(tbl = cold_data, size = 10000)
sample_100000 <- dplyr::sample_n(tbl = cold_data, size = 100000)
```

### Now estimate the proportion of those with a cold in the random samples

```{r results-from-the-smallest-samples, echo=FALSE}
sample_5 %>% summarize(sample_mean_n5 = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
sample_100 %>% summarize(sample_mean_n100 = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
sample_1000 %>% summarize(sample_mean_n1k = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
sample_10000 %>% summarize(sample_mean_n10k = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
sample_100000 %>% summarize(sample_mean_n100k = mean(had_cold_yesterday))
```

### Look at the sample's estimated proportion as a function of sample size

* To help us decide I first sampled one person and took the mean of that sample.

* Then I added another person and took the mean of that sample of size 2 (n=2).
... and so on, until I had 5000 people. 

* The plot shows the estimated proportion vs. the sample size.

# inspirational TODO for CR/MKD (for future reference, not for right now): make this into a 
# shiny app that updates a growing plot after continuing to add one more person 
# into the sample to show how the estimate updated each time.

- Add in a third sample to compare how different samples perform in the short 
vs. the long run

### Summary of the example on estimating the proportion with a cold

- As the sample size increases, the estimated proportion becomes closer to the 
true proportion
- Random samples of the same size will provide different estimates of the true 
proportion, but will be closer to each other (and the true value) if they are 
"large enough"


### Density curves using `geom_density()`

- Recall the data on cesarean delivery rates across hospitals in the US. We can 
use these data to also make a density plot (also called density curve):

```{r cs-variation-plot-example, echo = F, warning=F, message=F, out.width="80%"}
CS_dat <- read_xlsx("Ch02_Kozhimannil_Ex_Cesarean.xlsx", sheet = 1)

CS_dat <- CS_dat %>% 
  dplyr::select(Births, `Cesarean rate *100`) %>%
  dplyr::rename(num_births = Births, cs_rate = `Cesarean rate *100`)

CS_dat <- CS_dat %>% dplyr::mutate(cs_rate_binned = cut(cs_rate, 32))

## Basic histogram from cesarean delivery. Each bin is 2 wide.
basic.hist <- ggplot(CS_dat, aes(x=cs_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  ggtitle("Basic histogram") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

# Draw with black outline, white fill
better.hist <- ggplot(CS_dat, aes(x=cs_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, colour="black", fill="white") + 
  ggtitle("Better histogram") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

# Density curve (students: be able to make density plots like this)
basic.density <- ggplot(CS_dat, aes(x=cs_rate)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = "Basic density") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

# Histogram overlaid with density curve
# overlaying density plots onto histograms is a bit tricky,
# so don't worry about learning this bit of code.
density.hist <- ggplot(CS_dat, aes(x=cs_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=2,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") +  # Overlay with transparent density plot
  ggtitle("Histogram and density") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

basic.hist + better.hist + basic.density + density.hist + plot_layout()

# plotting formatting ideas from : http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_(ggplot2)/

# this summary dataset shows the relationship between the proportion in each bin and the density
# since density is an area, you need to take the proportion (height) and divide by the bin width
# (here it is 2.02 based on how we chose our bins) to get the density.
CS.summary <- CS_dat %>% 
  group_by(cs_rate_binned) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop = round((n/sum(n))*100,2), 
         density = (n/sum(n))/2.02) 
```

### Density curves

- From this plot, we can see that the density curve approximates the shape of 
the histogram very well. 
- Remember because there are infinitely many cesarean delivery rates that could 
be observed between 0 and 1 it is impossible to assign a finite probability to
any specific number. 
- If we did, we could do this infinitely and their summed probability would 
surpass 100%. 
- Instead, the density curve is used to determine the probability of an observed 
event within a specific range.


### R recap:
The only new code in this lecture you need to remember is

`geom_density()`

Which is the function we use to generate a density plot within the ggplot package
